# NetSyncDB

## About NetSyncDB

NetSyncDB is a pioneering framework that combines the simplicity of SQLite's interface with the power of a decentralized, distributed network. Designed for seamless integration, it provides the familiar SQLite database operations along with advanced features like decentralized management and data sharding.

## Goals of NetSyncDB

- **SQLite Interface**: Offers the standard SQLite interface for database operations, maintaining ease of use.
- **Decentralized Data Management**: Implements a peer-to-peer network layer for robust data synchronization across devices.
- **Sharding for Scalability and Fault Tolerance**: Implements a sharding mechanism similar to RAID 5, allowing multiple server nodes to combine their storage capacities while ensuring data integrity and fault tolerance.
- **Adaptable and Scalable**: Suitable for various use cases, accommodating changes in network size and structure.
- **Data Security and Integrity**: Prioritizes high standards of data protection across the network.

## How to Use NetSyncDB

### Installation and Initial Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Get started by cloning the NetSyncDB repository.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed.
3. **Configure the Network**: Set your network configuration based on your specific needs.

### Standard SQLite Operations

- **Database Operations**: Utilize NetSyncDB just as you would SQLite for data creation, retrieval, and updating.
- **Seamless Integration**: Enjoy the familiar SQLite experience with the added benefits of decentralized networking in the background.

### Advanced Features

#### Sharding

- **Combining Server Nodes**: Similar to RAID 5, multiple server nodes can be combined to increase the overall storage capacity and add redundancy.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The system is designed to maintain data integrity even if several nodes fail, allowing for data reconstruction from remaining nodes.

#### Adding New Nodes

1. **Server/Admin Phone - QR Code Generation**:
   - Use the node management feature on a server/admin node to add new nodes.
   - Choose the role for the new node (admin/server or user) and generate a QR code for setup.

2. **New Node - Scanning QR Code**:
   - On the new device, open NetSyncDB and scan the QR code from the server/admin phone for automatic configuration.

### Data Synchronization and Redundancy

- **Automatic Data Sync**: NetSyncDB ensures consistent data across all nodes through automatic synchronization.
- **Dynamic Network Management**: The system adapts to network changes, such as adding or removing nodes, without disrupting data management.
